# MIDI-Generator

This code generates a MIDI file with a simple orchestral arrangement
consisting of cello, piano, violin, and viola parts.
The cello plays a melody, the piano plays chords, the violin plays a melody,
and the viola plays a harmony.

The code uses the midiutil library to create and manipulate MIDI files.
